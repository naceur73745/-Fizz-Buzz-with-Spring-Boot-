## FizzBuz*

 have created a project called "Fizz Buzz with Spring Boot." This project involves developing a small application with a REST API that receives an input value and returns a result list in JSON format.>
The application follows a specific set of rules based on the input number, generating a list of values starting from 1 up to the entered number. The rules are as follows:
If the number is divisible by 3, the application should return 'Fizz.'
If the number is divisible by 5, the application should return 'Buzz.'
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, the application should return 'FizzBuzz.'
Otherwise, the application should simply return the next number in the sequence.
By implementing these rules, the application provides a comprehensive response based on the input value, generating the appropriate Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz, or next number accordingly.
The project utilizes Spring Boot, a powerful Java framework for building web applications. With Spring Boot, I created the REST API and implemented the necessary logic to generate the desired results.
The output is returned in JSON format, ensuring easy integration and consumption by other systems or clients.
Overall, the "Fizz Buzz with Spring Boot" project demonstrates my ability to develop RESTful applications, leverage Spring Boot's capabilities, and apply logical rules to produce the expected output in a professional manner.
